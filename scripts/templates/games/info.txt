    NAME: Camel case name of game

For a card game which uses card builders and deck builders,
this file should contain:
    CARD_FIELDS: List of tuples e.g. [(<field_name>, <field_type>)]
    CARD_STR_FUN: callable which returns string for card instances, e.g.,
                  lambda self: f"{self.name}"
    CARD_FIELD_VALUES: dictionary whose keys are field names from CARD_FIELDS and whose values
                       are lists of allowed values for these fields, e.g.,
                       {'suit': ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades'],
                        'rank': ['Ace'] + [str(i) for i in range(2, 11)] + ['Jack', 'Queen', 'King']}
    card_generator: A callable which returns a generator of tupes representing the cards in the deck.

                    def card_generator():
                        return ({'suit': suit, 'rank': rank}
                        for suit in CARD_FIELD_VALUES['suit']
                        for rank in CARD_FIELD_VALUES['rank'])
